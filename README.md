# Database ETL Toolkit
 Inspired by the Udemy course (SQL - MySQL for Data Analytics and Business Intelligence)
</br>
A place holder for personal use that tracks Postregsql/MySQL queries in git.
Rules follow as:
</br>
1. I will always need that query again; </br>
2. Queries are living artifacts that change over time; </br>
2. Hope will be useful to any other data professions in the future. </br>
